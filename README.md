# Restaurant Menu Ordering App
A restaurant app that allows users to add themselves to a wait list and order food from their table with barely any human interaction. The website will open to the current restaurants' home page using a QR scanner. Here the user will be able to add themselves to a wait list. While waiting they can look at the menu and even start their order, so once they reach their table the order will start in the kitchen. 

Also includes:
- Drink refill from phone 
- Can order more items if they choose
- Customize their order as they want
- Reduces staff and client interaction
  - Only contact that the user will have with the staff is when they bring their food and drinks out
- Can pay bill from their phone
- Clients no longer have to wait on staff
